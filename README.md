# Project
Academic Team Project : In this project, I worked as a Full Stack Developer, implementing an online payment system using Stripe API. After users completed their orders, a PDF receipt was automatically generated with PDF-Sharp. I was responsible for managing the frontend, ensuring it followed the UX/UI design and worked smoothly with the payment system.
